# **Particle Simulation Project**
fun stuff but mainly to practice my client/server (API) architecture knowledge

**Short Description**: This project is a particle simulation developed in Java & Processing, where particles move and interact with obstacles in a 2D space. You can add, remove particles and manipulate obstacle to visualize dynamic particle physics. The project demonstrates concepts such as velocity, gravity, collision, and boundary detection. Have fun!

## **How to Use the Program**
**Requirements**:
- Processing IDE: This project requires the Processing IDE. If you don't have it, get it [here](https://processing.org/download).

**Opening the Project**
1. Open the Processing IDE.
2. In the IDE, go to File > Open... and navigate to the folder containing main.pde.
3. Open the main.pde file. This will load all the necessary files in the Processing IDE.

**Running the Simulation**
1. Once the project is open in Processing, click the Run button (the triangle icon) to start the simulation.
2. The simulation window will open, displaying particles and obstacles.

**Interacting with the Simulation**
1. Add Particles: To add particles, press "+" (or SHIFT + "=").
2. Remove Particles: To remove particles that are out of bounds or no longer needed, press "-".
3. Add Obstacles: Left-click within the window to place an obstacle at the cursor position.
4. Remove Obstacles: Right-click on an obstacle to remove it from the simulation.
5. Change Color Theme: Press the following keys to switch between color themes:
- Press 1 for the Light theme.
- Press 2 for the Dark theme.
- Press 3 for the Vibrant theme.
- Press 4 for the Contrast theme.

##  _Notes_
- Particles are programmed to bounce off the boundaries of the window, creating a confined space for the simulation.
- If particles move outside the visible bounds, they will be automatically removed from the simulation to optimize performance.
- Color themes allow users to customize the simulation's visual appearance, which can be especially helpful for users with color blindness.
